  author: Beyang and Quinn
  description: >-
    The Sourcegraph Podcast is a new show about developer tools and their
    creators. It can sometimes feel like a full-time job just staying on top of
    the latest libraries, frameworks, plugins, extensions, CLI tools, and
    developer apps. We want to help you do that, by giving you a window into the
    minds of some of the best and brightest people working at the forefront of
    developer productivity. You'll hear from dev tool company founders,
    open-source authors, and developer efficiency leaders inside some of the
    best engineering organizations. Our guests share war stories, origin
    stories, worldviews, histories, prognostications, and the tools and
    technologies they're most excited about today. If you're a programmer who is
    passionate about leveling up your own productivity or perhaps an aspiring
    dev tool creator yourself, this podcast is for you.

  author: Bloomberg
  description: >-
    Hosts Francesca Levy and Rebecca Greenfield navigate the productivity
    industry by way of their own experiences. In each episode, one of the two
    becomes a human guinea pig as she tries to solve a specific work-related
    problem. Using the advice of so-called productivity experts, the duo tackles
    obstacles like ineffective to-do lists, overflowing inboxes and unruly
    meetings. Self-improvement is, by some estimates, a $10 billion sector, but
    can any of the productivity hacks these experts preach actually improve
    Francesca and Rebecca's work lives? Follow along with their attempts,
    insights and missteps, and maybe find a solution that will work for you.

  author: Three Uncanny Four/HyperObject Industries
  description: >-
    In this podcast — whose profits go to charities helping those affected by
    Coronavirus — Emily V. Gordon and Kumail Nanjiani are uniquely qualified to
    lead you through this forced quarantine situation. They are both writers who
    work from home. Emily was a therapist and currently is a chronically sick
    person (see: The Big Sick) who often has to quarantine herself, and Kumail
    is her main caretaker. Plus, we both just like being at home. Let us advise
    you on how to stay calm and avoid cabin fever. Let us give you entertainment
    recommendations. Let us give you constant updates on the squirrel vs. bird
    war happening right outside our window. Let us not talk about the C word at
    all. And most of all, let us take all of the proceeds from this podcast and
    spread it amongst charities that are helping those who are hit hardest by
    this quarantine. 



    100% of the Net Revenue* from the podcast will be donated in equal portions
    to the following charities to support their efforts to assist those affected
    by the COVID-19 pandemic: 

    https://www.restaurantworkerscf.org/

    https://disasterphilanthropy.org/

    https://www.feedingamerica.org/


    *"Net Revenue” is defined as the “Advertising Gross Revenue” received by
    Hyperobject Podcast and Three Uncanny Four less agency fees and actual costs
    incurred to produce, distribute, and promote the Podcast.  “Advertising
    Gross Revenue” is calculated by the (cost per thousand) rate times the total
    impressions delivered.

  title: 'COVID Sucks, People Don''t'
  author: Hank Green
  description: >-
    So this situation is all awful, but people are working very hard to fight
    this disease, get it under control, and help the people who need help. This
    podcast is a weekly opportunity to spend some time thinking about those
    people...and then to remember that, actually, those people are all of us.
