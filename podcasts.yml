    Welcome to The Tip Off- the podcast where we take you behind the scenes of
    some of the best investigative journalism from recent years. Each episode
    we’ll be digging into an investigative scoop- hearing from the journalists
    behind the work as they tell us about the leads, the dead-ends and of
    course, the tip offs. There’ll be car chases, slammed doors, terrorist
    cells, meetings in dimly lit bars and cafes, wrangling with despotic regimes
    and much more. So if you’re curious about the fun, complicated detective
    work that goes into doing great investigative journalism- then this is the
    podcast for you.

  title: Works for Me
  author: Bloomberg
  description: >-
    Hosts Francesca Levy and Rebecca Greenfield navigate the productivity
    industry by way of their own experiences. In each episode, one of the two
    becomes a human guinea pig as she tries to solve a specific work-related
    problem. Using the advice of so-called productivity experts, the duo tackles
    obstacles like ineffective to-do lists, overflowing inboxes and unruly
    meetings. Self-improvement is, by some estimates, a $10 billion sector, but
    can any of the productivity hacks these experts preach actually improve
    Francesca and Rebecca's work lives? Follow along with their attempts,
    insights and missteps, and maybe find a solution that will work for you.
