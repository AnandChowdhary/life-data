  title: Works for Me
  author: Bloomberg
  description: >-
    Hosts Francesca Levy and Rebecca Greenfield navigate the productivity
    industry by way of their own experiences. In each episode, one of the two
    becomes a human guinea pig as she tries to solve a specific work-related
    problem. Using the advice of so-called productivity experts, the duo tackles
    obstacles like ineffective to-do lists, overflowing inboxes and unruly
    meetings. Self-improvement is, by some estimates, a $10 billion sector, but
    can any of the productivity hacks these experts preach actually improve
    Francesca and Rebecca's work lives? Follow along with their attempts,
    insights and missteps, and maybe find a solution that will work for you.
